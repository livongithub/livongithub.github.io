<p> A slightly heartier version of this soup - made with chicken stock and topped with pan-fried cubes of ham or pancetta - is also delicious. </p>

The key to keeping a green soup as green and vibrant as can be is not to overcook it. Once the peas and basil have been added to the pan you want to remove it from the heat and blitz it straight away. This can be made 3 days in advance if kept in the fridge, and up to 1 month if frozen.

<div class="recipe">
<ol>
<li> Put the oil into an extra large saucepan and place on a medium high heat. Add a whole garlic cloves and fry for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently until they turn golden. Add the courgettes, 2 teaspoons of salt and plenty of pepper and continue to fry for 3 minutes, stirring continuously, until starting to brown. Pour in the stock, along with 500mL of water, and bring to the boil on a high heat. Cook for 7 minutes, until the courgettes are soft but still bright green. </li>
<li> Add the peas, stir through for 1 minute, then add the basil. Remove from the heat and, using a stick blender or liquidizer, blitz until the soup is smooth and vibrant green. </li>
<li> When ready to serve, spoon into eight bowls and top with the feta and lemon zest. Finish with a good rind of black pepper and drizzle of oil. </li>
