<h1> un souvenir <br> de voyage </h1>


<p> <em> After a long stay in Morocco, Maman brought back memories and recipes home. The most marking meal of her trip was Harira
<br> <br> <br>
 Alongside Couscous and Tagines, Harira is one of the most emblematic Maghrebi dishes. Its popularity stems from its warm flavors of ginger and cinnamon, and its silky yet chewable texture. Filled with nutrients from chickpeas, lentils, vermicelli and meat, Harira is a full meal leaving you warm and satiated.
<br><br> <br>
Commonly eaten during Ramadan, Harira is a hydrating and nutritious meal perfect for Iftar. Bringing together families and friends during the holy month, the dish proves itself as uniting and nourishing.
<br> <br> <br>
No two Hariras taste the same. Recipes vary between regions and families. Some alter the spices, the meats or even the lentils to adapt the meal to their personal liking.
<br> <br> <br>
Although I love my motherâ€™s recipe, she claims that it will never live up to what she had experienced during her trip.</em>  </p>
